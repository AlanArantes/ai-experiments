# AI Experiments Repository

Welcome to the **AI Experiments Repository**! This repository is dedicated to housing and documenting various Jupyter notebooks, code scripts, and resources related to machine learning and artificial intelligence experiments.

## Repository Overview

This repository is structured to help you explore, understand, and replicate AI experiments efficiently. It contains:
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Step-by-step, well-documented notebooks with code and results from experiments.
- **Python Scripts**: Reusable code components and modules for conducting various machine learning and deep learning tasks.
- **Data and Results**: Sample datasets, generated results, and figures that are referenced in experiments.

The purpose of this repository is to foster learning and allow others to build upon these experiments for research, academic work, or personal projects.

## Repository Structure

The repository follows an organized structure for easy navigation:

````markdown
/repo
  ├── experiment_1/
  │   ├── notebook.ipynb
  │   ├── data/
  │   └── results/
  ├── experiment_2/
  │   ├── notebook.ipynb
  │   ├── model.py
  │   └── utils.py
  └── README.md
````

Each experiment folder typically contains:
- **notebook.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook that explains and executes the experiment.
- **data/**: Folder containing any datasets or data files used in the experiment.
- **results/**: Folder for storing experiment outputs, including model files, visualizations, and performance metrics.
- **utils.py** (optional): Supporting functions, helper scripts, or modules for the experiment.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlanArantes/AI-Experiments.git
   cd AI-Experiments
2. **Install Dependencies**:
Use the requirements.txt file in the root directory to install all necessary packages.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Run an Experiment**:
Navigate to an experiment directory and open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook experiments/experiment_1/notebook.ipynb
4. **Customizing and Extending**:
Feel free to modify the code and add new experiments. Each experiment is self-contained, making it easy to extend and create variations.
